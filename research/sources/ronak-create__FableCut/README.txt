FableCut is a Premiere-style non-linear video editor that runs entirely in your
browser — and exposes its whole timeline as one JSON document. Edit it by hand,
from the UI, or let an AI agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or anything that
speaks MCP/REST) cut your video for you while you watch the timeline update
live.

Zero npm dependencies. One `node server.js`. That's it.

![FableCut editor](docs/screenshot.png)

## Why it's interesting

Most "AI video" tools hide the edit behind an API. FableCut flips that: the
**project file is the interface**. `project.json` describes media, clips,
tracks, effects, keyframes and transitions — any process that can write JSON
can edit video, and the open browser UI hot-reloads within ~150 ms via
server-sent events. A human and an agent can work on the same timeline at the
same time.

## Features

**Editing**

- 3 video tracks + 4 audio tracks, drag/trim/split/snap, undo/redo
- **Settings** (cog in the top bar) — optional prefs stored in this browser via
  `localStorage`. Enable **Link timeline and Project bin selection** so picking a
  timeline clip highlights its media in Project, and clicking a Project item
  selects every timeline clip that uses it (off by default).
- **Direct manipulation on the monitor** — click a clip or title on the preview to
  move, resize (corner handles), or rotate (top handle, Shift-snap) it directly
- **Timeline multi-select** — rubber-band marquee (drag on empty track area),
  <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd/Shift+click</kbd> to add/remove clips, <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> to
  select all, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to deselect. Drag any selected clip to move the
  whole group; <kbd>Delete</kbd> removes all selected; <kbd>S</kbd> splits all
  selected at the playhead. Inspector shows an "N clips selected" banner.
- Beat & cue markers (tap <kbd>⇧m</kbd> on the beat during playback) with edge snapping
- Press <kbd>Alt+t</kbd> to add an in/out transition based on the playhead position over the selected clip. The last used transition is remembered as the default. Drag the overlay triangle to adjust duration; <kbd>Delete</kbd> clears the focused transition.
- Real decoded audio waveforms on clips
- **Project bin folders** — tree view with expand/collapse; drag media or folders to nest; right-click the **Project** tab → New folder; drop files onto a folder to import into it
- **Audio Hold** — timeline toolbar toggle: while paused, loops **one frame** of
  audio at the playhead (useful when stepping frame-by-frame). Scrubbing or
  frame-step retargets the held slice; meters stay live. **Play** / **Pause**
  turns it off.
- Canvas aspect presets (16:9, 9:16 reels, 4:5, 1:1) + project FPS select
  (24 / 25 / 30 / 50 / 60; non-preset rates show as Custom) + safe-area guides
- **Export frame / reframing** — composition canvas can be larger than the delivery
  crop (`exportFrame` in `project.json`). Preview dims the overscan; drag the
  **Export frame** handle to reframe (e.g. 16:9 canvas → 9:16 export). Fast export
  crops to the frame; Realtime export is disabled while a frame is set
- **Program Monitor zoom** — mouse-wheel over the preview zooms the composition
  toward the cursor (fit → up to **2 screen pixels per canvas pixel**). Magnified
  view uses **native scrollbars** so overflow stays reachable; middle-click or
  <kbd>Alt</kbd>+drag pans. The **Fit** button (shown while zoomed) resets to the
  fit-to-stage baseline
- Preview playback speed — shuttle the monitor through 1×/1.5×/2×/4× with **J**/**K**/**L**
  (from a stop <kbd>J</kbd>/<kbd>L</kbd> start playback; while playing <kbd>L</kbd> steps faster
  and <kbd>J</kbd> slower, <kbd>K</kbd> toggles play/pause and resets to 1×); affects the
  preview player only, never the export
- Resizable workspace: drag the divider between monitor and timeline (double-click resets), plus S/M/L timeline track-density presets (S hides thumbnails for compact tracks)
- **Zoom to selection** (<kbd>⇧Z</kbd>) frames all selected clips, not just one
- **IN/OUT work area** — set markers with <kbd>i</kbd> and <kbd>o</kbd> (<kbd>⇧I</kbd> / <kbd>⇧O</kbd> to clear). Enabling **Limit** constrains playback to the marked range and maps <kbd>Home</kbd> / <kbd>End</kbd> to the IN and OUT positions rather than the full timeline. <kbd>t</kbd> splits clips at the markers; <kbd>⇧t</kbd> trims clips to the work (between marker in and marker out) area.
- **Find & close gaps** — a gap is a stretch where every enabled track is empty (black frames). <kbd>g</kbd> jumps the playhead to the next shared gap (wraps; respects IN/OUT when both are set). <kbd>⇧G</kbd> closes the gap under the playhead by pulling later clips left on all enabled tracks.
- **Reset a property** — <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+click</kbd> an inspector **label** to restore that effect/prop to its default (paired fields like Crop L/R reset together). Matching keyframes for the prop are cleared too; transition labels clear the in/out transition.
- **Replace media** — the inspector's **Source** button (any video/audio/image/svg
  clip) swaps the underlying file while keeping position, trim, keyframes,
  transitions and every effect. Pick another item already in the bin or
  **Browse file…** to import and replace in one step. A video's linked L/R
  audio companions are swapped along with it; a shorter replacement clamps the
  trim to fit and toasts that it did so.
- **Multi-channel video audio** — a video with more than 2 audio channels gets
  a linked audio clip per channel, not just L/R (5.1, 7.1…). Extra audio
  tracks (A5, A6, …, capped at 16) are created automatically as needed;
  replacing a clip's media re-syncs the linked channel clips to the new
  source's channel count, adding/dropping extras and new tracks as needed.

**Look**

- 14 one-click filter presets (cinematic, teal-orange, noir, vintage, cyberpunk, sunset, midnight…)
- **Adjustment layers** — one clip grades everything below it, Premiere-style
- Full grade controls: brightness/contrast/saturation/hue, **temperature & tint**,
  blur, grayscale/sepia/invert, **vignette**, animated **film grain**
- Blend modes (screen, multiply, overlay…), fit modes (contain/cover/stretch),
  per-edge cropping, corner radius, flip H/V
- **Chroma key** (green screen) with tolerance/softness + spill suppression
- **AI background removal** (person cut-out, in-browser via MediaPipe)

**Motion**

- Keyframe animation on ~25 properties with easing
- **Keyframe markers on clips** — diamonds on the clip body at each unique
  keyframe time (tooltip lists channels; a count badge when several share a
  time). <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+←</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+→</kbd> jumps the playhead to
  the previous / next keyframe (selected clips first, else clips under the
  playhead)
- **Keyframe graphs** — toggle a property’s curve in the inspector to show an
  interpolated value graph beside the program monitor; click the graph to seek
- **Speed ramps** — keyframe `speed` and the engine time-remaps video *and* the
  export audio mix (the fast-into-slow-mo reel move)
- **Camera shake** and **RGB-split/chromatic aberration**, both animatable
- 17 transitions: fades, slides, wipes (4 directions), zoom, iris, spin, blur,
  whip-pan, **glitch**, **pop**

**Text**

- **Title styles** — one-tap cohesive looks (Impact, Elegant, Kinetic cut, Neon,
  Handwritten, Luxury, and more); new titles vary the font, placement and animation
  automatically instead of defaulting to one flat style
- Kinetic captions: typewriter, word-pop, word-slide, karaoke, **letter-pop**,
  **wave**, **bounce**, **shake**, **clip-reveal**, **zoom-in**, **font-cut**
  (rhythmic typeface cuts), **rise-mask**
- **Neon glow** for that TikTok caption look
- Font editor: system fonts, drop-in custom fonts (`library/fonts/`), and **any
  Google Font by name** — loaded automatically
- Gradient fills, outline, background pills, letter-spacing, line-height,
  weights, italic, uppercase, soft shadows
- **Text layout** — horizontal Align: left / center / right / **justify**
  (extra spaces between words). Drag a title’s corner handles to create a
  **text box** (`boxW` / `boxH`); further corner drags resize it (opposite
  corner stays fixed; <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> resizes from center; <kbd>Shift</kbd>
  locks aspect). Inside a box, text wraps at the fixed font size by default;
  enable **Scale to fit** to shrink the font so the whole block fits. **V-align**
  (top / middle / bottom) places the text block vertically in the box. Set Box
  W/H to `0` to return to hug-content sizing.

**Animated SVG clips**

- A first-class `svg` clip kind: CSS-`@keyframes`-animated SVGs render
  **frame-accurately** in preview and export (the compositor freezes the
  animation at any time). Agents can author their own vector overlays —
  lower-thirds, confetti, sparkles — as plain `.svg` files. Starters included.

**Remake a reference video**

- Give it a reference edit (a reel you like) and get back an **edit blueprint**:
  shot boundaries, music beats + BPM, a loudness curve, per-shot energy, the
  drop — plus the reference's **music track extracted** into your media, ready
  to rebuild the same idea with your own footage. Zero extra dependencies
  (ffmpeg does the decoding; onset/tempo detection is plain Node).
  `node analyze.js ref.mp4`, `POST /api/analyze`, or the
  `fablecut_analyze_reference` MCP tool.

**Asset library**

- `library/` folders surface as tabs in the UI: **Elements** (overlay art),
  **Sound FX**, **SVG** — drop files in, the open editor refreshes live

**Export**

- Fast export: browser renders every frame + an offline audio mix; ffmpeg
  encodes them via an **encoding profile** from `encoding-profiles.json`
  (keeps rendering if you switch tabs). The Export dialog has a profile
  selector; pin a project default with `encodeProfile` in `project.json`
- Realtime MediaRecorder fallback when ffmpeg isn't available

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronak-create/FableCut.git
cd FableCut
node server.js        # → http://localhost:7777
```

Requirements: **Node 18+** and a Chromium-based browser. **ffmpeg on PATH** is
optional but recommended (fast export + upload remuxing). AI background
removal fetches its model from a CDN on first use.

The server binds **127.0.0.1 only** (v1.3.1+). To use it from another device on
your LAN, opt in explicitly: `HOST=0.0.0.0 FABLECUT_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-ip> node server.js`.

Drop media into the window (or `./media/`), drag clips onto the timeline, edit,
export.

To keep your work outside the checkout, set **`FABLECUT_DATA_DIR`** — it moves
`project.json`, `media/`, `exports/`, `analysis/` and `library/` to a directory
you choose. Leave it unset and everything stays in the repo, exactly as before.

### Or install it as a Claude Code plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add ronak-create/FableCut
/plugin install fablecut@fablecut
```

That registers the MCP server for you and adds two skills — `edit-video` and
`remake-reel`. Your timeline and footage live in the plugin's own data
directory, so an update never touches them. Node 18+ and (optionally) ffmpeg
still need to be on your machine.

## Driving it with an AI agent

Everything an agent needs is in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — the complete
schema, semantics and recipes. Point any capable model at that file and it can
operate the editor end to end.

Three equivalent control surfaces:

1. **MCP** (best for Claude Code / Claude Desktop) — register the bundled
   zero-dependency MCP server once:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add -s user fablecut -- node "<path-to>/fablecut/mcp-server.js"
   ```

   **OpenCode** can use the same stdio server from its project or global
   `opencode.json` configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "mcp": {
       "fablecut": {
         "type": "local",
         "command": ["node", "/absolute/path/to/FableCut/mcp-server.js"],
         "enabled": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   For another MCP client, register a local stdio server with this equivalent
   command. The exact key names vary by client, but the command and arguments
   do not:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "fablecut",
     "transport": "stdio",
     "command": "node",
     "args": ["/absolute/path/to/FableCut/mcp-server.js"]
   }
   ```

   The server is intentionally client-neutral. It speaks MCP over stdio and
   does not require Claude-specific environment variables. Keep the path
   absolute, and use Node 18 or newer.

   Tools: `fablecut_status` (auto-starts the editor), `fablecut_docs`,
   `fablecut_get_project`, `fablecut_set_project`, `fablecut_patch_project`,
   `fablecut_import_media`, `fablecut_analyze_reference`,
   `fablecut_encode_profiles`.

   FableCut is also published on the **official MCP registry** as
   [`io.github.ronak-create/fablecut`](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=fablecut)
   — each release ships an MCPB bundle (`fablecut.mcpb`) that MCPB-capable
   clients can install directly.

   The surface is **token-efficient by design**: agents patch the timeline with
   small ops (`fablecut_patch_project`) instead of round-tripping the whole
   document, read a compact one-line-per-clip summary
   (`fablecut_get_project {compact:true}`), and fetch only the manual sections
   they need (`fablecut_docs {section:"props"}`).
2. **The file** — read `project.json`, modify, bump `revision`, write. The UI
   live-reloads.
3. **REST** — `GET/PUT /api/project`, `POST /api/upload`, `GET /api/library`,
   `GET /api/export/profiles`, SSE at `/api/events`. See CLAUDE.md for the full list.

Example: ask Claude Code *"cut these six clips to the beat markers, add a
teal-orange grade, put a word-pop caption on top and a whoosh on every cut"* —
and watch the timeline rebuild itself.

Or hand it a reference: *"here's a reel I like — analyze it and remake it with
my clips, same music"*. The agent calls `fablecut_analyze_reference`, gets the
blueprint (cuts, beats, BPM, energy, drop, extracted music), and rebuilds the
structure shot-for-shot with your footage.

**Conflict-safe concurrent editing**: the UI, the MCP tools, and direct
`project.json` writes all agree on a `revision` counter. If you edit a clip in
the UI while an agent is mid-task, the agent's next write is rejected (409 from
the REST API / a conflict error from `fablecut_set_project`) instead of
silently overwriting your change. The UI similarly detects when an agent write
supersedes a not-yet-saved local tweak and tells you with a toast instead of
dropping it silently.

## Project layout

```
server.js        zero-dependency HTTP server: static hosting, REST API, SSE,
                 ffmpeg export pipeline
app.js           the editor: timeline UI, compositor, keyframes, text engine,
                 SVG rasterizer, chroma key, exporters
index.html       single-page UI
style.css        dark editor theme
mcp-server.js    stdio MCP server exposing the editor to AI agents
analyze.js       reference-video analyzer: shots, beats/BPM, energy, drop,
                 music extraction (module + CLI)
CLAUDE.md        the agent manual (schema + recipes) — also served by fablecut_docs
encoding-profiles.json
                 Fast-export ffmpeg presets (hot-reloaded)
project.json     your timeline (created on first run; gitignored)
media/           project footage (gitignored)
analysis/        cached edit blueprints from /api/analyze (gitignored)
library/         default assets: elements/ sfx/ svg/ fonts/
exports/         finished renders (gitignored)
```

## Authoring animated SVG overlays

SVGs animate with plain CSS `@keyframes`. One convention: never hardcode
`animation-delay` — set `--d: 0.4s` instead, and the compositor drives time by
pausing all animations and rebasing their delays. Full rules + a skeleton in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#authoring-animated-svgs-the-svg-clip-kind); working
examples in [`library/svg/`](library/svg/).

## Notes

- The repo ships with **20 Google Fonts** (`library/fonts/`, OFL — see
  `LICENSES.md` there) and a set of self-authored SVG overlays and animated
  elements (`library/elements/`, `library/svg/`, MIT like the rest of the repo).
- `library/sfx/` is yours to fill (gitignored): sound-effect sites typically
  don't allow redistributing their files in a public repo, so FableCut doesn't —
  `library/sfx/README.md` lists good free sources.
- Export runs in the browser because the compositor *is* the browser; agents
  ask you to click Export (or render directly with ffmpeg from `media/`).
