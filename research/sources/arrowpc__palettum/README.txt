  Palettum is a web app and CLI tool that  lets you recolor images, GIFs, and videos with any custom palette of your choosing.<br>
  It lets you apply any custom palette by either snapping each pixel to its closest color (ideal for pixel-art styles), or blending the palette as a filter for a smoother effect.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Unfinished

macOS:

```bash
brew tap arrowpc/palettum
brew install palettum
```

If your system/package manager wasn't listed, you can install the precompiled binary from [releases](https://github.com/arrowpc/palettum/releases).

## Building the Project

If you want to build the project from source, follow these steps:

### CLI

To build the command-line interface (CLI) tool, run the following Cargo command from the project root:

```bash
cargo build -p cli
```

The executable will be located in the `target/debug/` directory (or `target/release/` if you add the `--release` flag).

### Web App

The web application uses a WebAssembly module compiled from Rust code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is highly recommended to use `rustup` for managing Rust toolchains rather than a system-wide installation. This helps avoid potential issues, especially when compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` targets.

To set up and run the web application:

1.  **Navigate to the web frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Compile the WASM binary (release mode):**
    ```bash
    bun run wasm:build:release
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

### Self-Hosting with Docker

To build and run the web application using Docker:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t palettum .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 palettum
    ```

    The web application will then be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost`
