Video editing software designed for motion effects and versatility.

In addition to essential features like basic cut editing, animation, sound mixing, external library extensions, project management, and text editing, our software offers a wide range of powerful tools.

It also supports layer-based editing, which differs from traditional track-based editing. This approach makes it easier to apply multiple effects to individual assets, providing greater flexibility and creative control.

## About The Project

## Installation

First, install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

and, **Download** ffmpeg and ffprobe into `./bin`, in a folder named for the
target you are building. Only the folder matching your machine is needed to run
the app locally; `npm run build` reads whichever one it is packaging for.

```
bin/
  darwin-arm64/{ffmpeg,ffprobe}     Apple Silicon
  darwin-x64/{ffmpeg,ffprobe}       Intel Mac
  win32-x64/{ffmpeg.exe,ffprobe.exe}
  yt-dlp
```

Compatible binaries can be downloaded from
https://github.com/cartesiancs/ffmpeg4nugget

The macOS builds must be **native** — an x86_64 binary runs on Apple Silicon
through Rosetta 2 at roughly half the export speed, and nothing in the app will
say so. Check with `lipo -archs bin/darwin-arm64/ffmpeg`, which must print
`arm64`. The build also has to carry `libx264`, `libx265`, `libvpx-vp9`,
`prores_ks` and the VideoToolbox encoders; `ffmpeg -encoders` lists them.

next, **Permission** grant is required. Please enter the command below to grant permission for bin folder.

`chmod -R 777 bin`

## Running

```
npm run dev
npm run start
```

## Roadmap

Our ultimate goal is to empower creators to produce motion graphics effortlessly. We hope they can achieve stunning motion effects without relying on heavy software like After Effects.

Please refer to the [roadmap file](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for more details.
