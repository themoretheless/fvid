# Media over QUIC

[Media over QUIC](https://moq.dev) (MoQ) is a next-generation live media protocol that provides **real-time latency** at **massive scale**.
Built using modern web technologies, MoQ delivers WebRTC-like latency without the constraints of WebRTC.
The core networking is delegated to a QUIC library but the rest is in application-space, giving you full control over your media pipeline.

**Key Features:**

- 🚀 **Real-time latency** using QUIC for prioritization and partial reliability.
- 📈 **Massive scale** designed for fan-out and supports cross-region clustering.
- 🌐 **Modern Web** using [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API), [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API), and [WebAudio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
- 🎯 **Multi-language** with both Rust (native) and TypeScript (web) libraries.
- 🔧 **Generic** for any live data, not just media. Includes text chat as both an example and a core feature.

> **Note:** This project implements [moq-lite](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/moq-lite), a forwards-compatible subset of the IETF [moq-transport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/) draft. moq-lite works with any moq-transport CDN (ex. [Cloudflare](https://moq.dev/blog/first-cdn/)). The focus is narrower, prioritizing simplicity and deployability.

## Getting Started

Full documentation lives at **[doc.moq.dev](https://doc.moq.dev)**.

- **[Run the demo](https://doc.moq.dev/setup/demo/web)** - try MoQ locally with a relay, demo media, and the web UI.
- **[Agent setup](https://doc.moq.dev/setup/agent)** - teach your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) how to build with MoQ.
- **[Linux packages](https://doc.moq.dev/setup/linux)** - install the relay and GStreamer plugin from `apt.moq.dev` / `rpm.moq.dev`.
- **[Production setup](https://doc.moq.dev/setup/prod)** - deploy a relay with a real domain and TLS.

The quickest way to see it in action (requires [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)):

```sh
# Runs a relay, demo media, and the web server
nix develop -c just
```

Then visit <https://localhost:8080>. Don't have Nix? See the [demo guide](https://doc.moq.dev/setup/demo/web) for manual setup.

## Architecture

MoQ is designed as a layered protocol stack.

**Rule 1**: The CDN MUST NOT know anything about your application, media codecs, or even the available tracks.
Everything could be fully E2EE and the CDN wouldn't care. **No business logic allowed**.

Instead, [`moq-relay`](rs/moq-relay) operates on rules encoded in the [`moq-net`](https://docs.rs/moq-net) header.
These rules are based on video encoding but are generic enough to be used for any live data.
The goal is to keep the server as dumb as possible while supporting a wide range of use-cases.

The media logic is split into another protocol called [`hang`](https://docs.rs/hang).
It's pretty simple and only intended to be used by clients or media servers.
If you want to do something more custom, then you can always extend it or replace it entirely.

Think of `hang` as like HLS/DASH, while `moq-lite` is like HTTP.

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Application   │   🏢 Your business logic
│                 │    - authentication, non-media tracks, etc.
├─────────────────┤
│      hang       │   🎬 Media-specific encoding/streaming
│                 │     - codecs, containers, catalog
├─────────────────├
│    moq-lite     │  🚌 Generic pub/sub transport
│                 │     - broadcasts, tracks, groups, frames
├─────────────────┤
│  WebTransport   │  🌐 Browser-compatible QUIC
│      QUIC       │     - HTTP/3 handshake, multiplexing, etc.

## Protocol

Read the specifications:

- [moq-lite](https://moq-dev.github.io/drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-lite.html)
- [hang](https://moq-dev.github.io/drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-hang.html)
- [use-cases](https://moq-dev.github.io/drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-use-cases.html)

## Development

Contributions are welcome, including AI-assisted issues, pull requests, reviews, and comments. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-contributions) for the attribution policy and guidance on when to open an issue before writing code.

```sh
# See all available commands
just

# Build everything
just build

# Lint and compile what your branch changed
just check

# Test what your branch changed, same scope
just test

# Automatically fix some linting errors, same scope
just fix

# Same as the above, over every package
just check-all
just test all
just fix-all
```

CI runs these same two recipes, so they cover the same ground locally. It sets two things you don't: `MOQ_STRICT=1`, which turns a missing tool into an error instead of a skipped check, and `NEXTEST_PROFILE=ci`, which allows a longer hang timeout.
