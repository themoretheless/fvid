# Cosmos Curator

A powerful video curation system that processes, analyzes, and organizes video content using advanced AI models and distributed computing.

## Important

Please run `git submodule sync` if you have cloned the repository before and just pulled the latest update.
We updated the URL for `cosmos-xenna` submodule on 08/04/2025.

## Overview

Cosmos Curator is a comprehensive solution for video processing and curation using state-of-the-art AI models,
which powers the training data generation for [Cosmos](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/) at NVIDIA.
It is built on top of a framework optimized for GPU-accelerated streaming pipeline,
which is now open-sourced independently as [Cosmos-Xenna](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-xenna).

## Features

- **Video Processing**: Efficient video splitting, annotation, filtering, deduplication, and dataset generation
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced video analysis using multiple model families
- **Distributed Computing**: Scalable processing using [Cosmos-Xenna](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-xenna) built on top of [Ray](https://www.anyscale.com/product/open-source/ray)
- **Cloud Integration**: Support for various platforms
- **Pipeline System**: Modular and extensible pipeline architecture

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available under [docs/](docs/README.md) directory.
