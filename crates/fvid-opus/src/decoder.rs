/// packet to a fresh decoder does not produce the same audio as decoding it in
/// sequence.

/// used, so a decoder needs no configuration beyond the rate and channel count
/// the caller wants back. It follows the stream wherever the encoder went,
/// including mode and bandwidth changes mid-stream.

/// Missing packets are expected rather than exceptional. Call
