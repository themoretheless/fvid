//! Soft clipping for float output on its way to integer PCM.
//!
//! An Opus decoder's float output is not bounded by ±1. The codec rings, and a
//! signal mastered close to full scale comes back slightly over it — this is
//! true of libopus as well, and is not a defect in either. It only becomes
//! audible when the float is converted to integer PCM, where anything past the
//! range saturates into hard, broadband distortion.
//!
//! Hard clamping is the obvious fix and the wrong one: it flattens the peak
//! into a straight line, and the corner at each end of that line is a
//! discontinuity in the first derivative that spreads energy across the whole
//! spectrum. What this does instead is bend the waveform down smoothly — the
//! libopus `opus_pcm_soft_clip` algorithm, which fits `x + a·x²` over the run
//! between the zero crossings either side of a peak, choosing `a` so the peak
//! lands exactly at 1.
//!
//! # Why it holds state
//!
//! A peak can straddle a frame boundary. Fitting each frame in isolation would
//! bend one half of such a peak and leave the other half alone, putting a step
//! at the boundary — the same discontinuity the curve exists to avoid, just
//! moved. So the coefficient in use at the end of a frame carries into the
//! next, and the first samples of that frame continue the curve until the
//! signal crosses zero. [`SoftClip`] is that carry.
//!
//! This is why it is a type rather than a function: the state has to live
//! somewhere, one copy per stream, and a caller who has to remember to thread a
//! scratch array through every call will eventually not.
//!
//! # When you need it
//!
//! [`OpusDecoder::decode_s16`] applies this already, matching libopus, where
//! `opus_decode` soft-clips and `opus_decode_float` does not. Reach for
//! [`SoftClip`] directly when you take the float output yourself and convert it
//! to integer PCM downstream.
//!
