//! Reading an Opus packet's shape without decoding it.
//!
//! Every Opus packet starts with a TOC byte describing its mode, bandwidth,
//! frame duration and channel count, followed by a frame-packing code
//! (RFC 6716 §3.1). That is enough to answer the questions a muxer or a
//! remuxer needs to ask before handing the packet to a decoder.
//!
//! [`samples_48k`] is the unit Ogg counts in — granule positions are at 48 kHz
//! whatever rate the encoder ran at — and is what
//! [`OggOpusWriter::write_packet`] reads out of a packet for you.
//!
//! ```
//! use fvid_opus::packet;
//!
//! # fn f(pkt: &[u8]) -> fvid_opus::Result<()> {
//! // How long is this packet, without decoding it?
//! let samples = packet::samples_48k(pkt)?;
//! let millis = samples as f32 / 48.0;
//! # let _ = millis;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
