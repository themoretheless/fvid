//! Turning a decoded Ogg Opus stream back into exactly the audio that went in.

/// Trims an Ogg Opus stream's decoded output back to the original audio.
///
/// An Opus stream decodes to more samples than were encoded, at both ends, and
/// RFC 7845 describes both corrections:
///
/// - **Pre-skip** (§4.2). The first [`OpusHead::pre_skip`] samples are the
///   encoder's algorithmic delay, not audio, and are discarded.
/// - **End-trim** (§4.4). The final page's granule position may claim *fewer*
///   samples than its packets decode to. Opus codes whole frames, so a clip
///   that is not a whole number of frames long is padded on the way in, and the
///   short final granule is how the encoder says where the audio actually
///   stopped. Every file `opusenc` writes carries one.
///
/// Both are driven by what the container says rather than by counting packets:
/// a page's granule position is the number of samples decodable through the
/// last packet completed on it, so holding the output to it is an equality on
/// every page but the last, and the end-trim on the last.
///
/// Skipping the first is conspicuous: the stream starts a few milliseconds
/// late. Skipping the second is not. It appends up to one packet — 120 ms at
/// the limit, typically the tail of a 20 ms frame — of padding past the end of
/// the audio, which is inaudible on a clip played once and an audible gap at
/// every seam of a loop.
///
/// Both corrections are a few lines of arithmetic that every consumer of the
/// container would otherwise write, and both fail silently when they are
/// written wrong. `Trim` is those lines, once.
///
/// # Using it
///
/// Construct it from the header, hand it each packet with the samples that
/// packet decoded to, and write out what comes back.
///

///
/// # Scope
///
/// One logical bitstream, decoded from its first packet and starting from
/// granule zero, as [`OggOpusReader`](super::OggOpusReader) yields it. It
/// counts what it has been given and compares that against an absolute granule
/// position, so a `Trim` cannot be joined to a stream already in progress, and
/// a stream restarted from the beginning wants a fresh one alongside the
/// decoder's [`reset_state`](crate::OpusDecoder::reset_state).
///
/// It trusts the granule positions, which is the only thing it can do with a
/// forward-only reader. A file whose granules go backwards or under-claim
/// somewhere other than the end is malformed, and this keeps whichever of the
/// two — audio or granule — promises less, so such a file loses audio rather
/// than gaining silence.
