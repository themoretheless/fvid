# Shared owned compressed-video kernels

`fvid-codecs` compiles the canonical AVC, HEVC, VP9 and AV1 source modules once. The root crate reexports these modules; `fvid-media::owned_codecs` exposes the same public types. Shared error and fallible allocation primitives live in `fvid-control`. Canonical source files remain in this monorepo; this change does not qualify standalone package publication. The player feature retains HEVC worker priority through `fvid-platform`.

Plain WebM VP9/AV1 requests now dispatch through these kernels in both native-only and legacy-enabled fvid-media builds. AV1 configuration OBUs initialize the decoder before packets, including files whose first packet has no sequence header. Malformed packets propagate errors; explicitly unsupported tools remain capability refusals. The native-only API refuses transformed compressed sources rather than silently dropping options.

This is a migration step, not complete FFmpeg independence. MP4 edit-list and rotation workflows, transformed compressed-video workflows, remaining exports and codec/profile gaps still require migration. Root media and CUDA features still enable legacy-ffmpeg. Presence in the capability inventory denotes linked packet-decoder components, not acceptance of every container workflow or profile.

Verification: shared-kernel unit tests, root and standalone media unit tests, native deband/perspective regressions, eight shared-codec integration tests and the offline native dependency guard. Ordinary tests require neither FFmpeg nor network access.

## MP4 dispatch

Plain MP4 AVC/HEVC without presentation edits or rotation now uses the shared packet decoders in fvid-media. AVC decode-order output includes B pictures; HEVC counts only pictures marked for output and reports cropped dimensions and source depth. No FFmpeg API is called on this admitted path. Edit lists and transforms remain explicit refusals in native-only builds, and retain their existing legacy route in legacy-enabled builds. This preserves the scope boundary without silently discarding presentation timing or requested filters.

Four short synthetic MP4 fixtures exercise AVC baseline/B pictures and HEVC Main/Main10. The pure Python generator replaces complete edit containers with same-size free boxes, preserving every packet offset. Tests compare native root and standalone frame count, dimensions and pixel format; refusal tests separately assert that real edit lists and transforms remain unadmitted.
