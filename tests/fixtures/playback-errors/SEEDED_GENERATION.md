# Offline playback fixture regeneration

Run `python3 scripts/generate_playback_error_samples.py` to regenerate the
28-file MP4/MOV/WebM/PCM regression corpus. Use `--output-dir PATH` for review
without changing checked-in fixtures. Generation uses only Python's standard
library and never invokes FFmpeg, libopus, another encoder or the network.

`synthetic-playback-seeds.zip` preserves the existing synthetic control clips
and independently produced Opus PCM references. These are the original public
96x64 test patterns and tones, not private recordings or parameter sets. This
is seed-based reproduction, not a new FVid encoding implementation: encoded
controls and reference PCM remain fixed; MP4 edit lists, sample entries and
composition timestamps are constructed by the generator itself. Keeping fixed
seeds preserves the original failures and packet/pixel/PCM expectations across
machines, including the explicitly forced Opus hybrid mode.

The seed JSON records SHA-256 for every archived file. All seeds are validated
before output creation. The generated JSON pins all 28 outputs including
metadata mutations. Run `python3 scripts/test_seeded_playback_generator.py`
explicitly to verify exact reproduction and corruption rejection. Ordinary
Cargo acceptance tests consume existing fixtures and never run the generator.

The prior FFmpeg/libopus-based generator was replaced; reference provenance is
retained here rather than presenting reference PCM as independently computed
by FVid. Other fixture generators/validation workflows remain separate work.

The Y4M header grammar, bounded line reader and container probe are now owned by
`fvid-media::owned_y4m` / `owned_y4m_probe`. Frontend compatibility uses the same
parser source body and delegates metadata inspection; it does not introduce a
second independent grammar. Public library probing selects the owned route for
progressive 8-bit and 9/10/12/14/16-bit 420/422/444. Legacy-enabled probing retains
its prior backend for unsupported chroma/interlace modes.

`tests/native_y4m_library_probe.rs` checks 13 chroma/depth forms, frontend/library
metadata equality, reduced fractional frame rates, tagged frame markers, bounded
header lines and truncated payloads. Synthetic frame payloads are constructed in
the test itself; no private media, external codec or fixture generator is used.
Core Y4M processing and root/domain API compatibility tests remain enabled.
